1) What is Java inheritance?




java allows one class to incorporate  another class into its declaration





2) How does inheritance work?





using the extends keyword. Thus the subclass adds to the extends superclass




class subclass-name extends superclass name





3) What are some advantages that inheritance provides?





it allows a subclass to inherit all of the variables and methods defined by the superclass and adds its own unique elements






4) What does the "super" keyword do?




calls a superclass constructor




it accesses members of the superclass





5) In what order are constructors called when there are multiple subclasses?





in order of derivation






6) What does it mean when a method is overridden?






when a method im a subclass has the same return type and signature as a method in its superclass, then the method in the subclass is said to override
in the superclass






7) How do overridden methods support polymorphism?




allows you too call a method with the same name and same number of parameters and they will behave differently




8) What is the difference between an overloaded method and an overridden method?





        overloaded - method same name but takes different parameters




        overridden - overrides means the subclass method will execute before the parent class







9) What is dynamic method dispatch?



where java automatically picks which method to run based on the number of parameters when there is a similar method shared
between classes in an inheritance ladder







10) What does the "final" keyword do?










setting a variable in a parent class that can never be changes in the subclasses







11) Are classes in Java are a subclass of what super class?



Object
