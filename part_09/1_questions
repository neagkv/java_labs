1) What is the difference between a byte stream and a character stream?

a byte stream preforms input and outputs of data in 8 bite bytes, a character stream reads data character by character instead of bite by bite

2) List at least 3 examples of byte stream classes?

1.)InputStream
2.)FilterInputStream
3.)OutputStream


3) List at least 3 examples of character stream classes?
1.)BufferedReader
2.)StringReader
3.)FileReader

4) What is try-with-resources? Why is it super cool?

a statement that contains an object that must be closed after using. The try with rescources automatically calls the
close() method when the object is done being used.


5) Demonstrate a try-wth-resources block:

static String readFirstLineFromFile(String path) throws IOException {
    try (BufferedReader br =
                   new BufferedReader(new FileReader(path))) {
        return br.readLine();
    }
}


6) What does the read() method on the FileInputStream class return?

the input bite by bite

7) What is the documentation above of the FileInputStream class header say? (hint: inside /** ... */)
?


8) Is a DataOutputStream used for bytes or characters?

characters

9) What is a BufferedReader?

convert the input from byte to characters

10) Why does a BufferedReader require an InputStreamReader as an argument?

because it must take in the arguments as byets before it can convert them to characters

11) What does the InputStreamReader dp with it's byte stream argument?

converts the bytes into characters

12) What is the difference between the read() and readLine() on BufferedReader?

readLine will only read upto the first line in the text

13) Demonstrate instantiating a BufferedReader that will read a file called "yucatan_cenotes.txt"

ufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(new File("yucatan_cenotes.txt")));
