Answer the following questions:

1) What is an array?

    a container object that holds a fixed number number of objects of a certain type

2) What the code required to create (instantiate) a String array with size 10 named "cats"?

        String [] cats = new int [10]

3) What is a multidimensional array?

        an array of arrays

4) What is the code required to create (instantiate) a 2-dimensional int array that is 6 high and 6 wide named "scores"?

            int[][] scores = new int[6][6];


5) Using code, how do you retrieve a String that is the 10th item in a traditional array named dogs?

            String dogs = new String [9]

6) What is an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException?

        when you are trying to access and illegal index of an array, greater than the size of the array of useing a negative number


7) Using one line of code, demonstrate how to retrieve the second to the last item from a int array.

            int a = a [a.length -2]



8) What is the maximum allowable size of an array in Java?

    the size of the largest int


9) What is a bubble sort?

   a very inefficient sorting algorith
   requires a nested for loop
   outer loop must ryab as many times ad the length of the length of the collection -1
   inner loop compares sequential pairs and swaos them if need be
   depending on wheter you're staring from the bottom or the top, the next smallest number
   will bubble to the top each subsequent loop (or vice versa, largest number bubble to the bottom on each loop

10) How does a bubble sort work?

    look at the last question

11) When might you use an irregular array? What is a good example of an irregular array?

        an array that holds the # of passengers of a bus when the  bus schedule that runs 5x per week and 2x on the weekends



12) Demonstrate how to iterate through an array, printing each value, using a for loop.

        for( int i =0; i< length.arry; i++) {
        sout (arry[i]);

13) Demonstrate how to iterate through an array, printing each value, using a while loop.
          int i

        while(i < length.arry) {System.out.println(arry[i); i++;}


14) What is a queue?


         its a list in which elemnets are accessed ub first-in-first-out order.



15) What are the two primary operations that a queue performs?

        - put and get



16) What is a stack?




17) What differentiates stacks and queues?

            queue is first in first out

            stack is last in first out

18) When would you use an enhanced for loop?

        when you want to iterate over every item in an collection and you don't need access to the index.
        the for each loop

19) What is "The Collections Framework"? What classes does it include?

        a library that holds a collection of classes with reusable data structures
        it includes lists, vectors, sets and maps

20) How do you iterate over a two-dimensional array? Demonstrate using psuedo code.

            //assumes nums in a 2D array, ie nums [][]
            for(int[] x : nums){
            for(int y : x) {
            sout(y);
            }
            }

            for(int i = 0; i < nums.length: i++){
            for(int j =0; j < nums[i].length; j++){
            sout(nums[i][j];
            }
            }



21) What is a String?

                 an immutable sequence of characters
                 an object type not a primative type

22) What are a few common methods for operating on Strings?

            string.length;
            string1.concat(string2);



23) What does "Strings are immutable" mean?

24) Using the CLI, how do you invoke a Java application and provide two parameters to the main method?


        # javac ClassName.java
        # java ClassName arg 1 arg 2
