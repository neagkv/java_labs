            int[][] scores = new int[6][6];


5) Using code, how do you retrieve a String that is the 10th item in a traditional array named dogs?

            String [9] dogs = new String [9]

6) What is an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException?

        when you are trying to access and illegel index of an array, greater than the size of the array of useing a negative number


7) Using one line of code, demonstrate how to retrieve the second to the last item from a int array.

            int a[a.length -2]



8) What is the maximum allowable size of an array in Java?

    the size of the largest int


9) What is a bubble sort?

    a sort that compares adjacent elements in an array and swaps them and repeats untill the all the elements have been placed into the correct order

10) How does a bubble sort work?

    look at the last question

11) When might you use an irregular array? What is a good example of an irregular array?

        an array that holds the # of passengers of a bus when the  bus schedule that runs 5x per week and 2x on the weekends


12) Demonstrate how to iterate through an array, printing each value, using a for loop.

        for( arry i =0; i<=length.arry; i++) { sout(i)}

13) Demonstrate how to iterate through an array, printing each value, using a while loop.

        while(i<length.arry) {System.out.println(i);}


14) What is a queue?


         a first in first out way to arrange elememts in java



15) What are the two primary operations that a queue performs?

        add and remove an item from a list



16) What is a stack?

            last in first out


17) What differentiates stacks and queues?

            queue is first in first out

            stack is last in first out

18) When would you use an enhanced for loop?

        when you want to iterate through all the elements of an array

19) What is "The Collections Framework"? What classes does it include?

        a library that holds a collection of classes with reusable data structers

20) How do you iterate over a two-dimensional array? Demonstrate using psuedo code.

             int[][] board = new int[4][4]; // let's loop through array to populate board
             for (int row = 0; row < board.length; row++)
             { for (int col = 0; col < board[row].length; col++)
            { board[row][col] = row * col; } }




21) What is a String?

                 an immutable sequence of characters

22) What are a few common methods for operating on Strings?

            string.length;
            string1.concat(string2);



















23) What does "Strings are immutable" mean?

24) Using the CLI, how do you invoke a Java application and provide two parameters to the main method?
