Answer the following:

1) What are the access control modifiers (acm) provided in Java?

    public private and proctected

2) Briefly explain each acm and how they differentiate from each other?

    the protected modifier applies only when inheritance is involved
    the methods in other classes cannot access a private member of another class

3) Why do we use acm's?

    to prevent access to private data.

4) What is the risk of not using acm's?

    improper  data can be assigned

5) Write a method signature that receives an object of type "Car" as a parameter.

    public static void myMeth (car a);

6) Write a method signature that returns an object of type "Car".

    public static car a myMeth ();

7) What is a very important consideration to keep in mind when passing objects (hint: by reference) from one
method to another?

    a new object is not created, it is just reffering to the previous object

8) What is method overloading?

    when two or methods in the same class have the same name, but different parameters

9) Why is method overloading useful? (Hint: as compared to the implementation in the C language.)

       it allows related methods to be accessed by use of a common name

10) How do you overload a method? What signifies that a method is being overloaded?

    a method will have the same name as another method but will have different parameter types or different number
    of parameters


11) Below, by writing just the method signature, demonstrate overloading a method 3 times.

    void myMeth(){}
    void myMeth(int a) {}
    void myMeth(int a, int b) {}

12) How do you overload a constructor? What signifies that a constructor is being overloaded?

    just like a regular method. The methods name will be capitalized and will and take different parameters

13) Why do we overload constructors?

    it allows you to construct objects in a variety of ways

14) Below, by writing just the constructor signature, demonstrate overloading a constructor 3 times.

    MyClass(){}
    MyClass(int a){}
    MyClass(double a){}
    MyClass(int a, int b){}

15) What is recursion?

    a method that call itself

16) What important considerations must you keep in mind when using recursion?

    

17) How do you make a method recursive?

18) How do you escape a recursive method?

19) Explain what "static" is all about?

20) When should you use "static"?

21) What differentiates static variables from instance variables?

22) What is a the quicksort? Briefly describe how the quicksort works.

23) What is a nested, or inner, class?

24) What is the scope of a nested class?

25) What is a variable-arity method?

26) What makes a variable-arity method unique? When should you use it?

27) What is the shorthand name for variable-arity?

28) Why important considerations must you keep in mind when using variable-arity methods? (hint: ambiguity)
